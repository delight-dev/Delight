## Configuration file. Available options:
##    ServerUri - URI that points to where remote asset bundles are stored
##    BuildTargets - controls which model data is included in build
##    ContentFolders - specifies where Delight content (views, models, etc) resides (besides the default folders)
##    StreamedBundles - specifies which bundles (by name) should be streamed locally rather than from remote URI
##    ServerUriLocator - name of class that locates server URI based on bundle name
##    UseSimulatedUriInEditor - set to true/false indicating if a simulated server URI should be used in the editor
##    Namespaces - Namespaces to be included in the generated code and prioritized when infering types
##    DelightPath - Delight framework root path
##    DefaultBasedOn - Default view all views are based on if the BasedOn attribute isn't specified (UIView if not specified)
##    BaseView - Custom view all views will inherit from.
##    AssetBundleVersion - Set to non-zero integer to enable caching of asset bundles. Increment to invalidate bundle caches and force new updates
##    Modules - List of modules to activate. E.g. To enable TextMesh Pro, download the latest package with the package manager and add TextMeshPro to config file.
