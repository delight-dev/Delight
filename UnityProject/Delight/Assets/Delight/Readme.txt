Introduction
------------

Delight is an open source component-oriented framework for Unity, mainly centered around creating user-interface components that can easily be extended, combined and shared using a text based declarative design language (similar to HTML).

Quick Start
-----------

1. Import the package to your project.

2. Create a new scene by right-clicking in your project hierarchy and choosing:

Create -> Delight Scene.

Press enter and open the newly created NewScene.xml XML file and edit it so it contains the following content:

    <NewScene xmlns="Delight" 
              xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
              xsi:schemaLocation="Delight ../Delight.xsd">
        <Label Text="Awesome!" />
    </NewScene>

3. Open the Unity scene NewScene.unity that has been created in the same folder and run it.

Congratulations, you’ve created your first scene in Delight :).

Check out the Tutorials at https://delight-dev.github.io/ and get started creating some awesome UI components.
